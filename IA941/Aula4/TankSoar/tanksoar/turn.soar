## Turn Operator Proposal
# If the tank is blocked in the forward direction, and not blocked in the
# right or left directions, then propose the turn operator for the unblocked
# direction. Also create an indifferent preference for the operator.
# This operator will also turn on the radar and set the radar-power to 13.
# If the tank is blocked in the forward direction, and in both the right or
# left directions, then propose the turn operator left.
